# No-Show-appointments
This project from Data analysis professional track from Udacity.
I chose No-show appointments dataset which contain information from 100K medicl appointments in Brazil and is focaued on the question whether or not patients show up for their appointments.A number of characteristics about the patients are included in each row:
        -ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
        -Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
        -Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
        -Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
